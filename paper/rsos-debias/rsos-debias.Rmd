# Introduction (FR)

<!-- CCA: PROPOSED PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE-->

<!-- P1: The emergence of Digital Footprint Data (DFD) has created new opportunities, particularly for research and policy - e.g. footfall, temporary changes in population, service demand, business. -->

<!-- P2: However, DFD is subject to biases that may compromise its representativity. Addressing these biases is critical because, if big data analyses rely on biased data, this can perpetuate social injustice and unfairly amplify socioeconomic disparities. -->

<!-- P3: Biases in DFD can arise from various sources. Here, we focus on coverage biases caused by access and use of digital technologies and representational biases, caused by the specific profiles of the people that tend to use those techonologies [specify sources such as demographic gaps, digital divides, or sampling limitations]. -->

<!-- P4: Efforts have been made to measure and explore the nature of biases across multiple data sources (brief literature review). -->

<!-- P5: However, we identify two main gaps. First, there is no standard approach for identifying or correcting biases in spatially and temporally aggregated DFD. Second, little work on the geographic variation of biases. Developing transparent, well-documented standards is essential, especially since most DFD sources are aggregated and, for privacy reasons, do not include user profile information. -->

<!-- P6: This paper aims to establish a framework to address this gap, contributing by proposing a standardised approach for identifying and measuring biases in DFD, as well as explaining the origin of these biases. -->

<!-- THE THREE PARAGRAPHS BELOW WERE WRITTEN BY FR -->

<!--  The rapid growth in mobile phone penetration globally has created new opportunities for research, policy and decision making. Though the collection of call records, data streams, Mobile phones record highly precise and frequent location information in real time. As such, -->

<!-- Location data extracted from mobile phones represent a great resource to understand the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility; that is, how and where people move. However, differences in the access and use of digital technology, such as smartphone applications across the population create biases leading to variations in the statistical representation of population groups in the resulting datasets. These biases have represented a major obstacle, leading to skepticism and deterring widespread use of these data. Work has made some progress on addressing biases for data capturing basic population attributes, such as sex and age. Less has been done at addressing biases for data which do not disclose population attributes. This paper provides a general overview of existing biases and state-of-the-art approaches, and discusses potential avenues for future research. -->

<!-- Focus on aggregated data to ensure privacy and confidentiality -->

Technological advances in computational power, storage and digital
network platforms have unleashed a data revolution producing large
trails of digital trace data containing location information.
Particularly demand for mobile services have propagated the development
and usage of mobile software applications on smartphones and wearable
devices. These applications have resulted in the generation of large
volumes of geospatial data offering novel opportunities to understand
spatial human behaviour, and hence revolutionising research and business
activities 
[@rowe23-bigdata]. Mobile phone application data (MPAD) offer high
spatially granular, frequent and instant information to capture and
understand human activities at unprecedentedly high resolution and
scale, with the potential to produce real-time actionable intelligence
to support decision making. MPAD have become a critical part of the
digital economy, creating new market opportunities for data intelligence
businesses, such as Cuebiq/Spectus, Safegraph and Locomizer, and
supporting policy making prominently during the COVID-19 pandemic. MPAD
have been deployed for inferring mode of transport [REF], monitoring
footfall changes [REF], profiling daily mobility signatures [REF],
sensing land use patterns [REF], predicting socioeconomic levels [REF],
defining urban extents [REF], estimating tourism [REF] and estimating
migration and population displacement [REF].

However, the use of MPAD present major epistemological, methodological
and ethical challenges [@rowe23-bigdata]. A key unresolved challenge is
the potential presence of biases in MPAD compromising their statistical
representativeness and perpetuate social injustice [REF]. Biases reflect
societal digital and socioeconomic inequalities. Biases emerge from
differences in the access and use of the mobile phone applications used
to collect data [@wesolowski13-biases]. Only a fraction of the
population in an area owns a smartphone, and even an smaller share
actively use a specific mobile phone app. In the UK, for example, 98% of
the adult population have a mobile phone and 92% of this population use
a smartphone [@ofcom23], but a smaller percentage actively use Facebook
(70%) or Twitter (23%) [@statista24]. Additionally, biases emerge from
differences in the access and use of digital technology across
population subgroups reflecting socioeconomic and demographic
disparities. For instance, wealthy, young and urban populations
generally have greater access and more intensively use of mobile phone
applications, and therefore tend to be over-represented in MPAD [REF].

The use of biased MPAD can thus have major practical and societal implications. Selective patterns of smartphone ownership, application usage and digital engagement may lead to inaccurately capture of population patterns and distorted representations of human activities, disproportionately reflecting behaviors of younger, urban, and higher-income users while underrepresenting marginalized or less-connected groups

Direct consequences 

- inaccurate patterns

- distorted representation

## Implications

As a result, population statistics derived from digital trace data
cannot provide population-level representation. They can only offer
rough signals about the spatial distribution of (e.g. spatial
concentration), trends (e.g. increasing) and changes (e.g. low to high)
in populations [@rowe22-sensing-ukraine].

and amplify socioeconomic disparities

Aim: We propose an approach to measure biases -

Research questions:

Contribution:

Structure:

Efforts have been made to correct these biases through two general
approaches. A first general approach consists in adjusting DF-derived
population counts from social media by developing correction factors
(e.g. [@yildiz17-twitter], [@Hsiao24-bias]). Correction factors are
often estimated as the ratio of active social media users to census
population counts by demographic attributes (e.g. age). The principles
are similar to survey post-stratification methods i.e. to make
DF-derived population counts representative of the census populations.
However, a key data requirement of this approach is on having data on
population by attribute, but such data are generally unavailable from
DFs. Only information on location, time and total active users is
recorded. As such, this approach cannot be generalised to different DFD
sources and geographical contexts, and when applied on total population
counts, biases associated with demographic and socioeconomic user
attributes are not corrected (e.g. [@rodriguez-carrion18-biases],
[@schlosser21-biases], [@pak22-correcting-bias]). A second approach uses
a regression modelling approach. Intuitively this approach produces
representative population counts by explicitly measuring and removing
the sources of biases in the data [@kramer-schadt13-bias-correction].
This approach has primarily been used in Ecology to obtain
representative population distributions of animal species
[@zizka21-sampbias], but it has not been used in the context of DFD. In
recent work, the PI adopted a similar approach to correct multiple
sources of biases in census data to produce bias-adjusted migration
estimates [@aparicio-castro23-bayesian]. DEBIAS builds on this work to
develop a general framework and software package aiming to correct
biases in origin-destination mobility counts derived from DFs in the
absence of demographic and socioeconomic information on users of digital
platforms.

# Data and methods

[NOTE: I think that we need a paragraph describing and providing an
overview of the methodological strategy, including both data and
methods. Two points are particularly crucial to connect: (1) The use of
data from March 2021 for our assessment against census data; and (2) the
use of multiple data sources. We need to describe the idea of single-
and multiple-sourced app data. I wonder if we should include a table
listing their general attributes: advantages and limitations in terms of
their temporal and spatial coverage and resolution. This may not be the
place for the table but would be good to consider for the book if we
compared GPS data to other sources.]

<!-- Start with overview of dta and methods. Include here a figure of overview of data+methods (see slides for 1st advisory board meeting. Need to alter figure to differentiate between single source data and multi-source (multi-app) data !-->

## Data (CC)

### Facebook

We use anonymised aggregate location data from Facebook app users who
have the location services setting turned on on their smartphone for the
UK, covering March 2021, the month when the 2021 UK Census was carried
out. We use the Facebook Population dataset created by Meta and accessed
through their Data for Good Initiative
(<https://dataforgood.facebook.com>). Prior to releasing the datasets,
Meta ensures privacy and anonymity by removing personal information and
applying privacy-preserving techniques [@maas2019] . Small-count
dropping is one of these techniques. A data entry is removed if the
population or movement count for an area is lower than 10. The removal
of small counts may mean that population counts in small sparsely
populated areas are not captured. A second technique consists in adding
a small undisclosed amount of random noise to ensure that it is not
possible to ascertain precise, true counts for sparsely populated
locations. Third, spatial smoothing using inverse distance-weighted
averaging is also applied is applied to produce a smooth population
count surface.

The Facebook Population dataset offers information on the number of
active Facebook users in a spatial unit at a given point in time. The
data is temporally aggregated into three daily 8-hour time windows (i.e.
00:00-08:00, 08:00-16:00 and 16:00- 00:00). In this work, we are
interested in capturing resident population, so we consider only data
corresponding to the time window corresponding to the night-time hours
(00:00-08:00).

Spatially, the Facebook Population dataset is aggregated according to
the Bing Maps Tile System developed by Microsoft (Microsoft). The Tile
System is a geospatial indexing system that partitions the world into
tile cells in a hierarchical way, comprising 23 different levels of
detail (Microsoft). At the lowest level of detail (Level 1), the world
is divided into four tiles with a coarse spatial resolution. At each
successive level, the resolution increases by a factor of two. The data
that we used are spatially aggregated into Bing tile levels 13. That is
about 4.9 x 4.9km at the Equator [@maas2019].

We process Facebook Population data to enable comparison with UK census
data. Specifically, we take the average of daily Facebook Population
data over March 2021, the census month, and aggregate it into UK Local
Authority Districts (LADs) to align with the census data. This approach
is used to generate the figures and results in the body paper. In the
Supplementary Information, we test alternative approaches, including
averaging over a single week in March 2021, or performing the spatial
aggregation before temporal averaging. Our findings indicate that the
results remain robust regardless of the chosen approach

### Twitter

<!-- Argue better why Twitter data also falls in the umbrella of GPS data. Some entries are from GPS (geotagged posts) but we are also including others, like those geolocated from IP addresses !-->

We use an anonymised, openly available, analysis-ready dataset of active
Twitter users in the UK. The data is derived from X (previously Twitter)
in the form of monthly active user counts residing across the UK
geography. The dataset is based on tweets from UK users [@wang2022]
collected via the Twitter Academic API. These tweets are either
geolocated at the time of posting or manually geocoded using a bounding
box provided by the Twitter Academic API, based on the IP address of the
posting device. The full dataset includes 161 million tweets from
February 2019 to December 2021; however, we focus on data from March
2021 to align with the 2021 UK Census. Users' Local Authority District
(LAD) of residence is identified using a frequency-based home-location
algorithm. Further details on the dataset’s methodology can be found in
[@wang2022] .

While the X Academic API is no longer available to download data, but
existing and future projects offer an opportunity for research based on
X data. Global repositories of historical geolocated tweet data are
accessed through the Internet Archive (1996) and Harvard Geotweet
Archive (<https://gis.harvard.edu/data>). Despite these limitations, we
consider X data as it remains a key source of historical digital trace
data.

### Multi-app GPS data: source 1

We sourced data from a data analytics company that collects GPS location
data from around 26% of smartphones in the UK. The raw data is collected
for individual anonymised devices, from numerous smartphone applications
where the users have explicitly granted location-sharing permissions.
The full dataset covers 7 days corresponding to the first week of April
for the UK, including X GPS records and X unique devices. While the
dates covered by dataset do not exactly coincide with the 2021 UK Census
dates, the alignment is close.

We process the data to estimate users' place of residence based on a
commonly used rule-based classification (e.g. [@wang2022,
@zhong24working]), which assumes that the residence of a device owner
corresponds to the location with the highest number of GPS records
during night hours (7 PM – 7 AM). For a location to be classified as a
residence, it must account for more than 50% of recorded nighttime
locations and be visited at least twice during the period of study. To
ensure consistency when comparing with other data sources, we aggregate
these residence locations at the Local Authority District (LAD) level.

### Multi-app GPS data: source 2

Our analysis includes a second source of analysis-ready GPS location
data, which is openly-available on GitHub
([https://t.ly/dzlzB)](https://t.ly/dzlzB)). This dataset has already
been processed to identify the home location of users accoring to the
methodology described in [@zhong24working]. The raw data is collected by
a UK-based data service company, which licenses mobile GPS data from 200
smartphone apps and applies pre-processing methods to ensure user
privacy and anonymity. The full dataset covers the UK in November 2021.
While this period does not exactly coincide with the 2021 UK Census, the
difference of less than a year is considered sufficiently close for our
analysis.

To ensure consistency across datasets, we further process the data by
aggregating it spatially from the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA)
level to the Local Authority District Level (LAD).

## Methods

In this section, we outline our proposed methodology, which consists of
two interconnected stages aimed at quantifying two types of biases:
coverage biases and representational biases. Coverage biases relate to
the sample size of the dataset and refer to the proportion of the
population covered in the dataset. Representational biases, arise from
the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the users who
generate the digital trace data through specific technologies.

In the first stage of our methodology, we focus on quantifying coverage
biases by examining the variations in coverage across different spatial
units. We leverage the spatial granularity of digital trace data to
analyse coverage biases at more localised spatial scales. This allows us
to identify the extent to which different regions are represented within
the datasets, revealing any potential underrepresentation or
overrepresentation in specific locations.

In the second stage, we focus on quantifying representational biases. To
do this, we leverage the spatial heterogeneity of coverage biases and
model this variation in terms of demographic and socioeconomic variables
that characterise local populations. This analysis allows us to identify
which specific demogrpahic and socioeconomic population attributes, such
as average income, education level or age composition, are more likely
to be associated with higher values of coverage bias, thus highlighting
which population groups tend to be underrepresented in different sources
of digital trace data.

### Measuring coverage bias (CCA)

We define a metric to quantify the magnitude of coverage bias in each
subnational area. This metric is based on the population coverage of the
dataset, which we compute as the ratio of the population captured
(sample size) by dataset $D$, denoted as $P_i^D$, to the total local
population of an area, $P_i$. Formally, the coverage $c_i$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
c_i = \dfrac{P_i^D}{P_i} \times 100,
\end{equation} where $D$ identifies a given dataset, and $i$ denotes
each subnational area. The resulting ratio $c_i$ is assumed to take
values between $0$ and $100$, with 100 representing full population
coverage. If users have multiple accounts, the ratio can exceed $100$,
since the total sample size could be greater than the local population
of area $i$.

We then define the size of bias $e_i$ as:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:size-bias}
e_i = 100 - c_i
\end{equation}
```
In this case, a value of $e_i = 0$ indicates a lack of coverage bias,
which corresponds to full population coverage ($c_i = 100$). We use this
bias indicator to analysis the magnitude and spatial distribution of
coverage bias across multiple sources of digital trace data.

### Assessing the driving factors of bias (FR)

We seek to understand the association between the size of bias and
area-level demographic and socioeconomic attributes. To what extent
different demographic and socioeconomic groups are represented in DFD?
And how do these vary geographically and across digital platform? We
will assess these questions by measuring the area-level association
between our coverage indicator and key demographic and socioeconomic
attributes. We will use a random forest to model our coverage indicator
as a function of demographic and socioeconomic attributes. The outcomes
will identify the most important area-level demographic and
socioeconomic features to predict the coverage bias of a given digital
technology. We will use this information to inform our models in WP-II.

implementation of gradient boosting framework by [@friedman2001;

# Results

## Varying extent of bias across data sources

As digital trace data becomes increasingly accessible, it opens up new
avenues for studying human behaviours with remarkable temporal and
spatial precision, extensive geographic coverage, and near real-time
access. However, the potential presence of biases can undermine the
validity of the data to deliver statistically representative evidence.

In this section, we focus on quantifying the biases in multiple sources
of digital trace data that arise due to the extent of population
coverage, i.e. the proportion of the total population captured in the
dataset. In Figure , we contextualise these findings by comparing them
with various traditional datasets, particularly key UK surveys available
through the UK Data Service [@ukdataserviceSurveysData]. On the
$x$-axis, we represent two variables: at the top, the sample size of the
dataset, expressed as the number of respondents or subjects per 1,000
people, which reflects the population coverage of the dataset; and at
the bottom, a measure of bias in terms of this coverage, as defined in
equation \ref{eq:size-bias}. The figure highlights the remarkable
ability of digital trace data to capture a larger share of the total
population compared to traditional surveys, thanks to the automated,
passive nature of data collection on digital platforms. This contrasts
with the manual recruitment and data collection processes required for
surveys. As a result, the size of bias is generally lower for digital
trace data, highlighting its potential to inform comprehensive empirical
analyses.

<!-- Add no. of responses in legend (black dot) !-->

![Size of bias and population coverage (per 1,000 population) by data
source.](figures/compare-surveys-two-axis.png){#fig:survey}

While the findings in Figure \ref{fig:survey} demonstrate the potential
of digital trace data compared to traditional data sources, high
population coverage alone does not ensure the data is representative of
different population groups.

In surveys, specific strategies are usually implemented during the data
generation process to improve the statistical representativeness of the
sample. For example, sampling techniques such as stratified sampling or
cluster sampling can be applied so that the sample reflects the broader
population of interest. After sampling, if certain groups remain
under-represented, responses can be adjusted using post-stratification
techniques. However, even when these strategies are applied, there is no
guarantee that the survey will be fully representative of the broader
population of interest [@cochran1977sampling]. This is because
representativeness can only be achieved with respect to a finite set of
attributes (e.g. age, gender, income levels, location, etc.). Ensuring
perfect representativeness would only be possible either by surveying
the whole population.

With digital trace data, achieving statistical representativeness is
even more challenging. Unlike survey data, which is actively collected
using structured sampling methods, digital trace data is generated
passively as a byproduct of online interactions, transactions, or device
usage, without any control over who is included in the dataset.
Furthermore, by the time this data reaches researchers or analysts, it
is often anonymised, and does not contain demographic identifiers. As a
result, it is not possible to apply the standard post-stratification
weighting techniques that are typically used to adjust survey or census
data for improved representativeness.

We argue that, even though we do not always have specific demographic
information of the individuals captured through digital trace data, we
can infer some of these characteristics by leveraging the
spatio-temporal granularity of digital trace data. We argue that this is
a necessary first step to understand which population groups might be
under or over-represented in different sources of digital trace data.
This information is necessary to later adjust the data so that it is
more representative of the population of interest.

## The spatial distribution of biases (CC)

Next, we take advantage of the detailed geographic information in the
digital trace data to analyse bias at smaller, more localised spatial
levels. This helps us understand how well different geographic areas are
represented in the datasets. Since local populations vary in their
socioeconomic characteristics, we can use the degree of bias at these
smaller scales in the next step of our analysis, to determine which
population attributes are most associated with underrepresentation in
the data.

Figure \ref{fig:size-bias-spatial} shows the geographic variation of the
size of bias at the Local Authority District (LAD) level. Each row in
the figure corresponds to each of the digital trace datasets analysed
here. Within each row, we include: i) an hexagonal cartogram for the
size of bias in each LAD, representing the LADs as hexagons of equal
size to simplify the visualisation while maintaining relative positions;
with this cartogram, we report Moran's I as a measure of spatial
autocorrelation and its associated p-value, ii) a histogram of the size
of bias, showing the distribution of values across LADs, iii) a scatter
plot of the population covered by the digital trace data vs. the actual
population of each LAD; with the scatter plot, we include the Pearson
correlation coefficient and its associated p-value.

![](figures/Fig-size-bias.png){#fig:size-bias-spatial width="533"
height="418"}

Examining the spatial variation in bias size, we observe distinct
patterns across the DT datasets considered. These varied spatial
patterns likely stem from differences in the demographic composition of
users for each technology. Factors such as age, socioeconomic status,
digital literacy, and regional preferences for certain platforms or
devices may contribute to these variations. Bias tends to display
stronger spatial patterns for Meta data and the second source of
multi-app GPS data, with lower bias in the North of England and Wales.
In contrast, Twitter/X data and the first souce of multi-app GPS data
follow more mixed patterns, as demonstrated by the values of Moran's I
closer to zero. Twitter/X data generally exhibits high bias, except in
London, the South East, and a few isolated areas. Similarly, bias in
first source of multi-app data tends to be lower in the South and South
East.

Turning to the histograms, we observe that bias size is highest for
Twitter/X data, with all values exceeding 99.5 except for a single
outlier, the City of London. This outlier likely arises due to the
unique demographic and occupational characteristics of the area. While
relatively few people reside in the City of London, it hosts a large
number of workers, including temporary professionals, who may be staying
in hotels. The home-detection algorithm in [@wang2022] used to generate
the Twitter/X data used here might classify the workplace or temporary
accommodations of City of London workers as their primary residences,
leading to an anomalously low bias measurement. Following Twitter/X, the
second source of multi-app GPS data exhibits the next highest bias
values. In contrast, the first source of multi-app data shows lower
bias, while Meta data has the lowest overall bias. Notably, Meta data
also displays the widest distribution of bias values, indicating greater
variability across different locations.

The scatter plots show a high linear correlation between the population
covered by the digital trace data and the actual population of each LAD,
as demonstrated by the Pearson coefficient, all above 0.8. This suggests
that, on average, the actual population in the LADs is not an indicator
of the size of bias in DT data, as the population coverage $c_i$ remains
the consistent regardless of $P_i$ . This could be a result of the fact
that the biases in the data are not driven by the number of people, but
rather by other their demographic characteristics such as age, income or
educational level. In the next section, we explore the variability of
demographic attributes of local populations as possible determinants of
the size of bias.
