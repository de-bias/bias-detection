# Introduction

Focus on aggregated data to ensure privacy and confidentiality

Aim: To propose a methodological framework to measure biases in human population data from digital platforms.

Contributions:

# Data and methods

## Data

Twitter

## Methods

### Bias indicator

### Effective sample size

### Machine learning

eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework by @friedman2001 [@friedman2000].
